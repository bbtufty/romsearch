ROMMover
########

ROMMover will move the final chosen ROM files to a clean directory structure, optionally unzipping files along the way.

If a patch file is found and ROMPatcher is turned on, then the file will also be patched at this stage.

For more details on the ROMMover arguments, see the :doc:`config file documentation <../configs/config>`.
