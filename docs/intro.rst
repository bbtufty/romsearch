ROMSearch is designed as a simple-to-inferface with tool that will allow you to pull ROM files from some remote (or
local) location, figure out the best ROM, and move it cleanly to a folder that can imported into an emulator. ROMSearch
is supposed to be a one-shot program to get you from files online to playing games (which is what we want, right?).

ROMSearch offers the ability to:

* Sync from remote folder using rclone
* Parse DAT files as well as filenames for ROM information
* Remove dupes from ROM lists using DAT files as well as the excellent ``retool`` clonelists
* Moving files to a structured location, including potentially additional files that may be needed
* Discord integration so users can see the results of runs in a simple, clean way

To get started, see the :doc:`installation <installation>` and :doc:`configuration <configuration>` pages. For the
philosophy behind how ROMSearch chooses a ROM, see :doc:`1G1R <1g1r>`. Romsearch has a UI option which we recommend
for most users. For this, see :doc:`the GUI pages <gui/intro>`.

ROMSearch offers two modes: the default is "filter, then download" which will use the .dat file to find the best ROMs
and only download those. For data hoarders, we also offer a "download, then filter" option, which will download
everything and then filter from the downloaded files. For more details, see the
:doc:`ROMSearch module docs <modules/romsearch>`.

Currently, ROMSearch is in early development, and so many features may be added over time. At the moment, ROMSearch
has the capability for:

* Nintendo - GameCube
* Nintendo - Nintendo Entertainment System
* Nintendo - Super Nintendo Entertainment System
* Sony - PlayStation
* Sony - PlayStation 2
* Sony - PlayStation Portable

but be aware there may be quirks that will only become apparent over time. We encourage users to open
`issues <https://github.com/bbtufty/romsearch/issues>`_ as and where they find them. Known issues can be found at
:doc:`known issues <known_issues>`.

ROMSearch is also built in such a way that other platforms/filters can be added in a simple way using config files
rather than manually adding to the base code. For more details of how these work, see the various
:doc:`configs <configs>` pages.
