![ROMSearch](docs/images/rombrowser.png)

ROMSearch is designed as a simple-to-interface with tool that will allow you to pull ROM files from some remote (or
local) location, figure out the best ROM, and move it cleanly to a folder that can imported into an emulator. ROMSearch
is supposed to be a one-shot program to get you from files online to playing games (which is what we want, right?).

ROMSearch also has a GUI! Currently only for Windows, but makes setting up configurations simple, and also allows
for easy viewing of ROMs grouped into games via the ROMBrowser.

ROMSearch offers the ability to:

* Sync from remote folder using rclone
* Parse DAT files as well as filenames for ROM information
* Provide filename mappings between different DAT files
* Remove dupes from ROM lists using the excellent ``retool`` clonelists
* Match ROM hashes to RetroAchievements to get compatible ROMs 
* Patch ROM files so RetroAchievements can be enabled
* Moving files to a structured location, including potentially additional files that may be needed
* Grouping multi-disc games into a single .m3u playlist
* File (re)compression to a single-file, supported format
* Discord integration so users can see the results of runs in a simple, clean way
* View ROMs grouped into game titles, via the ROMBrowser
