0.0.6 (2024-05-23)
==================

Fixes
-----

ROMChooser
~~~~~~~~~~

- Language priorities are now baked into the ROM selection. ROMs with more (and higher priority) languages
  will now be preferred

ROMDownloader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a ``use_absolute_url`` option, which if False will strip the leading slash from the directories. This is
  potentially useful if using an HTTP remote
- rclone can now either sync or copy. It'll use sync if completionist mode is on, else it'll use copy which is
  a little cleaner
- If there are errors in the rclone command, ROMDownloader will now retry a few times
- Improved how rclone runs, to be less verbose and hopefully more reliable

ROMParser
~~~~~~~~~

- If no language is given in the ROM data, will attempt to pull this out from the region

General
~~~~~~~

- Updated dev tools for the new config directory structure
- Renamed `ftp_dir` to `dir` ion platform config files for clarity
- Fixed error message in GUI in includes/excludes existed for an unchecked platform


0.0.5 (2024-05-17)
==================

Features
--------

- ROMSearch now has a GUI! This currently is just used for a more friendly way to set the config file, but will
  be built out in the future
- ROMSearch now has two modes: the first is `filter_then_download` (default), which will use the dat file to filter,
  then only download relevant files. The second is `download_then_filter`, which will download everything and then
  filter. For data hoarders!

Fixes
-----

GameFinder
~~~~~~~~~~

- Ensure includes/excludes works the same as it does for ROMDownloader
- Includes/excludes will now search dupes as well, for consistency

ROMDownloader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Ensure output directory exists before downloading files

General
~~~~~~~

- Updates to .github workflows and templates
- `bool_filters` in the config file is now `dat_filters` for clarity
- Overhauled directory handling in the config file
- ROMSearch now has more clearly defined options
- Exposed log directory and cache directory
- Overhauled logging system to avoid unnecessary file bloat and I/O. Speed ups of about a factor 3
- Overhauled how config files are read in to avoid unneccesary I/O. Speed ups of about a factor 2
