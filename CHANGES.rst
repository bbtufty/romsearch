  a little cleaner

- ROMSearch now has two modes: the first is `filter_then_download` (default), which will use the dat file to filter,
  then only download relevant files. The second is `download_then_filter`, which will download everything and then
  filter. For data hoarders!

Fixes
-----

GameFinder
~~~~~~~~~~

- Ensure includes/excludes works the same as it does for ROMDownloader
